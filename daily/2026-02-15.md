## What I Worked On
- **Initial setup:** Sage identity, Telegram bot, API optimization
- **Models configured:** Haiku, Kimi k2.5, Sonnet, Opus, Gemini Flash 2.0
- **Cost optimization:** Set Haiku as default, Gemini Flash for background tasks
- **Skills installed:** summarize, obsidian integration
- **Vault synced:** sage-vault cloned to VPS, daily logging setup

## Decisions Made
- ✅ Use Haiku 4.5 as default (80% cheaper)
- ✅ Kimi k2.5 as fallback #1 (super fast)
- ✅ Gemini Flash 2.0 for heartbeats & cron (FREE tier)
- ✅ Daily logs → Obsidian vault (Git sync)
- ✅ Set rate limits & budgets ($5/day, $100/month)

## Blockers
- Tailscale not available in environment (switched to polling mode)
- obsidian-cli needs local Obsidian config (using direct file approach)
