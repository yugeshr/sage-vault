# Daily Mini Ideas — Tuesday, Feb 17, 2026

## 1. Color Palette Generator from Photo
**Problem:** Designers constantly extract color palettes from inspiration images manually. Build a one-click tool to upload a photo and get a clean 5-color palette with hex codes.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js + TypeScript, Canvas API (color quantization), Tailwind for UI

**Estimated Build Time:** 1.5 hours

## 2. Expense Tag Autocomplete
**Problem:** Tracking expenses is tedious. Build a minimal web app that learns your expense categories and auto-completes tags as you type (e.g., "cafe" → suggests "coffee", "lunch", "food").

**Tech Stack:** React + IndexedDB (local storage), simple Fuse.js for fuzzy matching, CSV export button

**Estimated Build Time:** 1 hour

---

## 3. Screenshot to Design System Asset
**Problem:** Designers often need to extract UI components from screenshots to reuse. Build a tool that takes a screenshot, lets you crop a component, and exports it as a clean SVG or PNG with metadata (dimensions, color palette).

**Tech Stack:** Vanilla JS + Canvas, Sharp for image processing, download as blob

**Estimated Build Time:** 1.5 hours
