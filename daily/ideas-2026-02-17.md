# Daily Mini Ideas — Tuesday, Feb 17, 2026

## 1. Screenshot Annotation Quick Tool
**Problem:** Designers often need to add quick callouts, arrows, and labels to screenshots for feedback, but Figma/markup tools are overkill for a 30-second annotation.  
**Solution:** A lightweight web tool that loads an image, lets you draw arrows, add text boxes, and export as PNG. No signup, pure client-side.  
**Tech Stack:** React + Konva.js (canvas library) or Fabric.js  
**Estimated Build Time:** 1.5 hours

## 2. CSS Variable Extractor & Palette Generator
**Problem:** When auditing design systems, extracting all CSS variables from a codebase and visualizing them as a color palette is tedious manual work.  
**Solution:** A CLI tool that scans CSS/SCSS files, extracts `--color-*` and `--spacing-*` variables, and generates an interactive HTML palette preview with hex/RGB codes.  
**Tech Stack:** Node.js + Glob + Cheerio + Handlebars  
**Estimated Build Time:** 1 hour

## 3. Photo Metadata & EXIF Tag Batch Processor
**Problem:** After a photography session, organizing and tagging 50+ photos with consistent keywords, location data, and camera settings is repetitive.  
**Solution:** A drag-and-drop tool that reads EXIF data from multiple images, lets you bulk-edit tags, add GPS coordinates, and export back with updated metadata.  
**Tech Stack:** Node.js + piexifjs + Electron (desktop app) or web with native File API  
**Estimated Build Time:** 1.5 hours
