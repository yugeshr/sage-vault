# Daily Mini Ideas — Tuesday, Feb 17, 2026

## 1. **Color Palette Extractor**
**Problem:** Designers spend time manually extracting color palettes from reference images. A quick tool to auto-extract dominant colors and generate complementary swatches would save 15+ minutes per project.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js + Cloudinary API (or sharp for local processing) + CSS Grid for palette display

**Estimated Build Time:** 1.5 hours
- Image upload UI (30 min)
- Color extraction logic (30 min)
- Palette display + export as JSON/CSS (30 min)

## 2. **Font Pair Suggester**
**Problem:** Picking heading + body font combos is a bottleneck. A tool that suggests proven font pairings based on mood/style (minimalist, bold, retro, etc.) and lets you preview them live.

**Tech Stack:** React + Google Fonts API + localStorage for favorites

**Estimated Build Time:** 1 hour
- Curated pair database (JSON) (15 min)
- Preview component (30 min)
- Filter by mood/category + favorites (15 min)

## 3. **Expense Screenshot OCR Logger**
**Problem:** Manually logging expenses from bills/receipts is tedious. A simple tool that reads expense screenshots, extracts amount/vendor/date, and logs to a JSON file for syncing with personal budgets.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js + Tesseract.js (OCR) + file-saver for export

**Estimated Build Time:** 1.5 hours
- Image upload + OCR processing (45 min)
- Parse expense data (30 min)
- CSV/JSON export + local history (15 min)
