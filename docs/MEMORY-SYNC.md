# 🧠 Memory Sync Process

Sage learns about Yugesh continuously and saves everything to the vault.

## How It Works

1. **Learn** → Sage discovers something new about you
2. **Update** → Saves to `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (current session) + `memory/MEMORY.md` (long-term)
3. **Push** → Auto-commits & pushes to GitHub
4. **Sync** → You pull locally → see updates in Obsidian

## Files Updated

- **`daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`** — Session log with discoveries
- **`memory/MEMORY.md`** — Long-term memory (curated learnings)
- **`config/YUGESH.md`** — Your profile (updated regularly)

## Examples of Learnings

- Background (5 years at Auzmor, Senior Product Designer)
- Skills (design, photography, web dev, design systems)
- Preferences (budget-conscious, practical builder)
- Goals (expense tracker, mini apps, automation)
- Interests (design + code hybrids, photography workflows)

## Every Push Includes

- Timestamp of discovery
- Context where you mentioned it
- Relevance to future projects

*This ensures nothing is forgotten and you have a complete record of what Sage knows about you.*
